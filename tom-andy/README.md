# jQuery and the DOM

**Author**: Andrew Helmer and Thomas North
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

We are creating a blog website that utilizes jQuery to access the DOM and populate index.html with articles using a constructor. The website will be responsive utilizing principles of SMACSS.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Install all the technologies that we used. Under js, Jquery, CSS, Html, and how these technologies interact with each other. Open VS Code. Use object constructors to create objects. Use Jquery to append the objects properties to the DOM.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

We are using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and icomoon.
