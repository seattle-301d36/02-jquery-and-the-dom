#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Max and Brandon paired together. It took about 1 hour 20 minutes**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on looked through index.html and answered the todo and reveiw items while building our familiarity and understanding of the code base.
  2. Next, we got the constructor working so that we could test our object implementation.
  3. Then, we used jQuery in one of our constructor's methods to populate the html document.
  4. Finally, we refactored the for loops into .forEach() useage and discussed the information in the review tags.
