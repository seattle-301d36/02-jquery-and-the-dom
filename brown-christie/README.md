## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is a dive into using dom manipulation using jQuery. This will allow highly dynamic sites that can create changes instantly or populate from saved data. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Starting with a data set, basic template html, a user would need to be able to build a constuctor for the data set, and build a method around that object to give it html attributes(correct terminology?).

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
jQuery is the main library being called upon boosting the capabilities of JavaScript. HTML, CSS, JavaScript were all used as well. 

## Change Log
