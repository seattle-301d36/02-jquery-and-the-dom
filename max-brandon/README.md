# jQuery and the Dom

**Author**: Brandon and Max
**Version**: 1.2.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- This application allows the script to add the articles into the DOM rather than being hardcoded into the html. -->

## Getting Started
<!-- Use of jQuery is necessary for understanding what is going on. To change the output of the articles, one would need to modify the blogArticles.js file, adding their own information and body text. This would be automatically appending to the website -->

## Architecture
<!-- The script is pulling out the template, cloning it, modifying it with specific article data, then re-appending it.-->

## Change Log
<!-- 07-11-18 9:00am: Cloned initial files and started work on the html
07-11-18 10:00am: worked through most TODOs except for re-appending the information on the clone
07-11-18 11:00am: finished everything!
