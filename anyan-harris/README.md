**Version**: 1.1.0

## Overview
This is a blog application that sorts the blogs stored in blogArticles.js, and displays them in "most recent" order.

## Getting Started
Clone the repo into your directory, and use live-server (or whatever server you prefer) to run the index.html. This should be sufficient to run the application.

## Architecture
This app uses the following libraries and solutions:
* Normalize.css: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
* jQuery: https://jquery.com/ 
* IcoMoon Fonts: IcoMoon.io

## Change Log
2018-07-11 1:59pm - Application now features a DRY sort methods and SMACSS optimization.
